## Pre-requisites

To work with this repository, ensure you have:

Tools:

-JDK 11+

-Java 17 or higher

-Gradle 7+

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone locally
3. Create a branch before working on an issue


## Local Run/Build

In order to build and test this whole repository you need JDK 11+.

#### Snapshot builds

For developers testing code changes before a release is complete, there are
snapshot builds of the `main` branch. They are available from
the Sonatype OSS snapshots repository at `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`
([browse](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/opentelemetry/contrib/))

#### Building from source

Building using Java 11+:

```bash
$ java -version
```

```bash
$ ./gradlew assemble

# Build the complete project
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run integration tests
$ ./gradlew integrationTest
```

### Test Types:

- Unit Tests: Isolated component tests.

- Integration Tests: Validate interactions between modules.

- CI Checks: PRs must pass all tests and linting.

Failure? Check logs for errors or mismatched dependencies.


## Contributing Rules

Style Guide: Follow the Java Instrumentation Style Guide.

### Gradle conventions

- Use kotlin instead of groovy
- Plugin versions should be specified in `settings.gradle.kts`, not in individual modules
- All modules use `plugins { id("otel.java-conventions") }`
